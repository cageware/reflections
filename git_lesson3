When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?
-> I'll use a remote repository when I'd like to keep a backup of my
files "on the cloud" and when I'm collaborating with others so we can
share updates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-> Remotes can be edited by other people outside, and to maintain the 
local repository in your control, I might want to pull changes
manually
