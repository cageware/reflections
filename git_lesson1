LESSON 1
This is my first reflection:  "We do not learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience"

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introducted?
-> The bug that was introducted was a result of a change to an existing code that did not have that bug.  Viewing the changes allowed me to see the differences that introduced that bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
->  Having access to a file's history can help me see how the file has evolved, what was done in the past as a solution, and what has not been tried that may be used as a potential future solution

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do on Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does
-> Pros: manual commits allow you to experiment with code before formally controlling it or sharing it with others; Cons: forgetting to commit (or waiting for an certain maturity before committing) can lead to development forks or missed introduction of code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-> Saving multiple files in one commit allows Git to provide a snapshot of all of the files needed for compliation on one place.

How can you use the commmands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
->  git log shows you a listing of past commits, and git diff allows you to see the differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
->  knowing that a previous version can easily be brought back allows me to make confident changes.  Also seeing the git diff between versions let me review areas that may have introduced bugs.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-> next use: intro to machine learning course that asks us to git clone a sample repository

Concepts:
-- Version Control -> Git allows for Commits
